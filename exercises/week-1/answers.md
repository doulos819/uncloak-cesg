# Week 1 Answers 

### Ch 1: 

- Q10. Describe a concrete example where improving the security of a system against one type of attack can increase the likelihood of other attacks.
	- This is more of an engineering question than a cryptograhy question per se; security versus performance, and security versus feature complexity are common recurring issue when designing a system. But to give a recent example, the SIKE key-encapsulation protocol was a finalist in the NIST Post Quantum cryptographic algorithm competition. The protocol made it through 5 years of analysis and 4 rounds of highly-public review, before finally revealing weaknesses in August 2022. New cryptographic algorithms may enable new use-cases, but sometimes come with poorly understood security assumptions, which can take years to discover. An engineer attempting to anticipate post-quantum security with a new algorithm increases their risk to not yet well-understood security risks.
	- The lesson: new algorithms, even with security proofs, are not necessarily secure! Time helps matters somewhat: an algorithm that hasn‚Äôt been broken in 10 years is more likely to remain unbroken than an algorithm proposed last month.

### Ch 2:
- Q3. Consider a group of 30 people who wish to establish pair-wise secure communications using symmetric-key cryptography. How many keys need to be exchanged in total.
    - - 435 keys would need to be exchanged.($N(N-1)/2$)) where $N$ = 30. If you aren't familiar with this formula, try deriving it yourself, and proving it with induction. Look up the Handshake Lemma or [Triangular numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number) for more details.

- Q4. Suppose Bob receives a messages signed using a digital signature scheme with Alice‚Äôs secret signing key. Does it prove that Alice saw the message and chose to sign.
    - No,  $K_a$ is long and difficult to remember, much less compute with. If a malicious party takes over Alice's PC, they might be able to forge Alice's signature. 

- Q6. Suppose a chosen-ciphertext attacker cannot recover the secret decryption key for an encryption scheme. Does this mean the encryption scheme is secure?
    - No. The attacker may still recover information about the message (broken diffusion), even if they cannot recover information about the key (successful confusion). See [Confusion and diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_and_diffusion). For example, AES in ECB mode does not leak information about the key, but is still obviously broken; you can [see the penguin](https://words.filippo.io/the-ecb-penguin/).

- Q7. Consider a symmetric-key cryptosystem in which cryptographic keys are randomly selected from the set of all n-bit strings. Approximately what should n be in order to provide 128 bits of security against a birthday attack.
    - $n = 256$ in order to provide 128 bits of security against a birthday attack. ($2^{n/2}$ where n = 128).

### General:

1. Suppose you read about RSA encryption and wanted to find it‚Äôs standard specification. Where would you look?
	- [IETF Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc3447/)

2. Find two libraries for each of RSA, TLS/SSL, and AEAD. Evaluate the maturity each library, and skim the code. What about the library structure makes sense? How is their documentation? These links may help:
- https://cryptography.rs/
- https://lib.rs/ (librs is equivalent to crates.io, with a different interface)
	- Repos:
		- The [RustCrypto](https://github.com/RustCrypto), [Ring](https://github.com/briansmith/ring), [RusTLS](https://github.com/rustls/rustls), and [Orion](https://github.com/orion-rs/orion) libraries are reliable references for many of the standard algorithms in the course, also see [Arkworks](https://github.com/arkworks-rs) for ZK specific algorithms. These libraries are typically thoroughly optimized and sometimes audited.
		- Some situations justify reaching for bindings to an implementation in another language, for instance, bindings to the standard [OpenSSL](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl) implementation--though in this case, the RusTLS implementation is known to be [more secure](https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-rust-based-tls-library-outperformed-openssl-in-almost-every-category/) than OpenSSL, *despite* not being standard üçÑ. While this course specifically covers Rust implementations of cryptographic algorithms, take a moment to look at the [HACL*](https://hacl-star.github.io/index.html) library of algorithms written in F*. The F* type system lends itself to native formal verification. The Project Everest/HACL* implementations and their [bindings (not yet in production)](https://github.com/franziskuskiefer/evercrypt-rust/tree/main/evercrypt-rs) are formally verified. F* cryptography implementations are especially valuable for widely used software; they have, for example, been deployed in the Linux Kernel and Firefox. Still, these F* lacks the performance and ease-of-implementation of Rust.
	- RSA:
		- https://github.com/RustCrypto/RSA - From the Rust Crypto developers. The example gives a clear example of how to use the library. The repo includes benches and integration tests, and includes a note about the auditing status. The repo is actively maintained. https://lib.rs/crates/ring - Most cryptography libraries will include RSA. Reach for any standard cryptography library.
	- TLS: See discussion above.
	- AEAD:
		- Many Rust Cryptography libraries will rely on standard trait marker libraries like [the RustCrypto AE with Additional Data Traits](https://github.com/RustCrypto/traits/tree/master/aead). The Rust cryptography community uses these traits to recommend general APIs for standard algorithms. AEAD is not an algorithm itself but a class of algorithms with a common API. Standard cryptography implementations typically contain most of their functionality within `impl TRAIT_NAME for MY_IMPLEMENTATION` blocks. See [AEADs/aes-gcm at master ¬∑ RustCrypto/AEADs ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/RustCrypto/AEADs/tree/master/aes-gcm) examples.
2. (a) Benchmark the speed of an algorithm in the two different implementations with [Criterion](https://lib.rs/crates/criterion).

3. (depricated) You‚Äôre implementing a Tweakable Encryption scheme. You need to know what standard API users will expect. Find a reference for the standard API and write the function signatures for encryption and decryption.
You want to understand a paper on a new polynomial commitment scheme, but you‚Äôve been trying for more than an hour, and the math is over your head. What do you do?

4. Implement the Vign√®re cipher in 100 lines or less.

5. (a) What is a side channel attack?

5. (b) Is your cipher implementation constant time?
